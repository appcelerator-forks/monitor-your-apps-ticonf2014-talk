# shwr.me demo

These are the slides of the TiConf NY 2014 and are versionned in this repository as an (optional) model for future JoliCode conferences. The slides are based on [shwr.me](http://shwr.me), a html and CSS based presentation engine.

## Generating a PDF

Generating a PDF can be achieved using Google Chrome (Print / Destination = "Save as PDF"). The generated PDF must be shrinked if too large. Use [OSX Quartz filters for downsampling the embedded images](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2010/02/25/better-pdf-file-size-reduction-in-os-x/).

A sample generated document is [available at Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/xavierlacot/monitor-your-app-a-complete-panel-of-titanium-monitoring-solutions).
