## Generating a PDF

Generating a PDF can be achieved using Google Chrome (Print / Destionation = "Save as PDF"). The generated PDF must be shrinked in too large. Use OSX Quartz filters for downsampling the embedded images.

A sample generated document is [available at Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/xavierlacot/monitor-your-app-a-complete-panel-of-titanium-monitoring-solutions).
